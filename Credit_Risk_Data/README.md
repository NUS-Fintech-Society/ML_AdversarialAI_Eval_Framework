Probability of Default (PD) tells us the likelihood that a borrower will default on the debt (loan or credit card). In simple words, it returns the expected probability of customers fail to repay the loan.
Loss Given Default (LGD) is a proportion of the total exposure when borrower defaults. It is calculated by (1 - Recovery Rate). For example, someone takes $200,000 loan from bank for purchase of flat. He/she paid some instalments before he stopped paying instalments further. When he defaults, loan has an outstanding balance of $100,000. Bank took possession of flat and was able to sell it for $90,000. Net loss to the bank is $10,000 which is 100,000-90,000, and the LGD is 10% i.e. $10,000/$100,000.
Exposure at Default (EAD) is the amount that the borrower has to pay the bank at the time of default. In the above example shown in LGD, outstanding balance of $100,000 is EAD

•	You could use standard tactics for expanding your share of a customer’s wallet, such as promoting a credit card when selling a mortgage or car loan. Or think more creatively. Use analytics to understand which credit cards to sell to specific customers based on their unique characteristics and what that might tell you about their rewards preferences. The frequent traveler may be more receptive to a card with air miles, the shopper more inclined to choose a card that offers discounts with partner retailers, the saving and investing types might prefer cash-back rewards.
